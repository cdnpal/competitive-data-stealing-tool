	 * 
	 * The previously had no licensing for the data they were stealing.
	 * 
	 * The joint AutoData/ChromeData project did not include TrueCar data that was taken and used
	 * by this application and the reports and updates to CarsDirect produced from it.
	 * 
	 * The reason explained was that HighGear had good SEO, but in reality it wasn't that good,
	 * They had the license for this or similar data a full year after it was being used by IB 
	 * by anonymous proxy and reverse engineering.
	 * 
	 * ACQUISITION REF: http://www.highgearmedia.com/blog/internet-brands-acquires-high-gear-media
	 * 
	 * The data would not have been directly licensable to Internet Brands, so the acquisition 
	 * circumvented that. Albeit way too late since they had already taken it over a year before
	 * on a regular basis.
